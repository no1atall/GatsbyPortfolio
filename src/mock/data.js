  paragraphOne:
    'Even at the tender age of 10, I had a fascination with computers. My dad was a tech enthusiast, and loved to collect various electronics, gadgets, and computer parts. I quickly inherited his love for technology, immersing myself for hours tinkering with the interior of old towers, mixing and matching parts, upgrading and learning about what makes a computer tick.',
  paragraphTwo:
    'This passion to learn and use the latest technologies has only grown with time.  The explosive growth of the internet has given birth to a whole online world, a world filled with knowledge. Never before has knowledge been more accessible that it is today. I find myself fascinated with this virtual work created by technology, and want to take greater part in its creation, design, and direction. Naturally, coding is the most direct manner to add my own touch to my little corner of the internet.',
